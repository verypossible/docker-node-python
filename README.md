# Docker Node Python

A minimal docker image with nodejs and python.

The Dockerfile makes use of build ARGS to allow the docker-compose.yml file to define nodejs and python
versions as well as base of the nodejs version.

Built images are shared on docker hub at [verypossible/node-python](https://hub.docker.com/r/verypossible/node-python).
